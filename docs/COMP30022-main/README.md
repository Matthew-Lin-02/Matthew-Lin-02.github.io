## Repository Structure

/docs: Contains all relevant documentation.

/assets: Contains all fonts and images used in the application.

/lib: Main source folder for the application's logic and UI components.

## Development Process

New branches are created for each new feature, including pages and their components and bug-fixes. 
Developed using the Run and Debug feature of VS-Code using Flutter Chrome. 

Create a new feature branch:
```bash
    git checkout -b "branch_name"
```
Commit changes:
```bash
    git add . 
    git commit -m "commit message"
```
Push changes:
```bash
    git push origin "branch_name"
```

## Contribution Process

Each addition to the codebase should use defined constants and include automated unit tests for the new components.

1. Create a pull request to main, including:
- images of the new features (when applicable)
- a short description of the changes
2. Obtain at least one approval before merging to main

## Testing

To run all unit tests within the "test" folder run: 
```bash
    flutter test 
```
